# data_analysis_projects
This repository holds my code/data sets for some of my data analysis projects.

## Vancouver Crime Data Project:
I transformed data from the Vancouver Police Department with Python and then visualized the data with Tableau. The Python file is called VancouverCrime.py. I wished to find regions of Vancouver that have below average crime levels as I'm interested in possibly working and/or moving there currently. And I also created visuals for other questions of interest. For example, which types of crimes are the most common? Or which months tend to have the most crime? Here is the [link](https://public.tableau.com/views/VancouverCrime_17667859563950/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to my dashboards on Tableau Public.

## Data Cleaning and some Feature Selection with Jupyter Notebooks:
Using Python, I cleaned a synthetic data set from Kaggle about student test scores. The notebook is in the file: BI Data Cleaning.ipynb. And the data set is bi.csv. Also, I performed simple feature selection using correlations and created scatter plots of the most correlated variables.

## Data Cleaning and some Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL:
Using SQL, I cleaned order entries in a synthetic cafe data set from Kaggle. Also, I performed some exploratory data analysis once the data had been cleaned on aspects such as an item's popularity and total revenue. The code is in the file: cafe cleaning.sql. And the data is in dirty_cafe_sales.csv.
